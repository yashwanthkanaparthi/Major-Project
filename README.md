MSMC: Multi-Spectral Meta Classifier model for land classification
Land cover classification using remotely sensed satellite images, is one of the important applications which provides information about the land cover. This project demonstrates image classification using deep learning techniques. The goal is to classify images into one of ten classes based on the visual features present in the image. Our hybrid approach categorizes the Sentinel-2 satellite-collected EuroSAT dataset. This project uses the Visual Geometry Group 16 model as a feature extractor which then ensembles with four classifiers, the first three are the base classifiers Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and XGBoost and the Long Short-Term Memory model is used as a meta-classifier. In this project, state-of-the-art technologies like Stacking and Majority voting is used to classify the remotely sensed images. The project also includes a user interface which accepts an image from the user and classifies it into one of the ten classes.  To conclude, the project demonstrates the effectiveness of combining multiple classifiers to improve image classification accuracy.
